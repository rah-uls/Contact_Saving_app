Developed a CONTACT SAVING Native APP connected with real-time firebasedatabase for storing all Data.
1. A native contact-saving application using Firebase allows user authentication with email and password via Firebase Auth.
2. Users can log in, and their contacts (name, phone) are stored under a unique user ID in Firebase Realtime Database.
3. XML layouts handle user-friendly input and display for login, registration, and contact management.
4. Firebase's Java API facilitates CRUD operations for authentication and database updates.
5. This ensures secure, real-time syncing and efficient user data management.
